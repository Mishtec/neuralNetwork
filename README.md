Question 1:
Using Java, please develop a neural network that mimics the behavior of an AND boolean gate. Weights, biases, and the activation function must all be implemented by you. Do not use any libraries for the functionality of the neural net; you implement it from scratch. You need to answer the following questions: 

a) How many hidden layers have you used?

b) What are the weights and biases of each node?

You should provide a simple driver to test it.
